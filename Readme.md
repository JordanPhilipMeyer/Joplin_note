# Joplin note

Joplin manages notes through a sqlite database. Aim of the project is to automatically 
create a daily note for my focus areas each day with copies from the prior day so I can
easily pick up on work that I left off on the end of the day. Inspired largely from Jeff 
Huang's blog on single txt file for logging work: https://jeffhuang.com/productivity_text_file/ 
This is ideal for someone who wants the simplicity of that system but with the flexibility and
portability of accessing notes in a central application across many devices like linux, windows, and android.
